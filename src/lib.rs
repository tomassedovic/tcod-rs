//! libtcod bindings for Rust
//! 
//! ## Description
//! [libtcod a.k.a. "The Doryen Library"](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/) is a 
//! free, fast, portable and uncomplicated API for roguelike developpers providing lots of
//! useful functions, such as:
//!
//! * Text-based graphics API
//! * Colors
//! * Keyboard and mouse input
//! * Path finding
//! * Field of View
//! * Portability (works on Windows, Linux and OS X)
//!
//! For the full set of features see the [libtcod features page](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/features/). 
//! 
//! All raw bindings are available via the `tcod-sys` crate, however the `tcod-rs` library aims to
//! provide safe, Rust-style wrappers for most of `libtcod`. These wrappers are not yet complete,
//! however.
//!
//! ### Features already implemented:
//!
//! * Colors
//! * Console
//! * Most of the System layer
//! * Field of View
//! * Map
//! * Pathfinding
//!
//! ### Features that are not planned to be implemented:
//! This are features that Rust already provides a good (and in most casese more idiomatic)
//! solution for:
//!
//! * Filesystem utilities
//! * Containers
//! * Pseudorandom generators
//! * Compression utilities
//!

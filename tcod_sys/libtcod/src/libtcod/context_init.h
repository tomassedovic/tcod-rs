    Create a new context with a window of the given size.

    Same as `TCOD_context_new_terminal`, but the following parameters have
    different effects:

    `pixel_width` and `pixel_height` are the desired size of the window in
    pixels.

    `renderer_type` is a `TCOD_renderer_t` type.

    `tileset` is an optional pointer to a tileset object.

    If `vsync` is True, then vertical sync will be enabled whenever possible.
    A value of true is recommended.

    `sdl_window_flags` is a bitfield of SDL_WindowFlags flags.
    For a window, a value of ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`` is recommended.
    For fullscreen, a value of
    ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`` is recommended.
    You should avoid the ``SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`` flag whenever possible.

    `window_title` is the title of the opened window.

    `out` is the output for the `TCOD_Context`, must not be NULL.

    Returns a negative error code on failure, `out` will unlikely be set in this
    case.

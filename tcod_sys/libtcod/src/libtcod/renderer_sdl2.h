    Render a console onto a managed target texture.

    `atlas` is an SDL2 atlas created with `TCOD_sdl2_atlas_new`.
    The renderer used to make this `atlas` must support
    `SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE`, unless `target` is NULL.

    `console` is a non-NULL pointer to the libtcod console you want to render.

    `cache` can be NULL, or be pointer to a console pointer.
    If `*cache` is NULL then a console will be created.
    If `*cache` isn't NULL then the console pointed to might be deleted or
    recreated, especially if it does not match the size of `console`.

    `target` can be NULL, or be pointer to where you want the output texture
    to be placed.
    The texture at `*target` may be deleted or recreated.  When this function
    is successful then the texture at `*target` will be non-NULL and will be
    exactly fitted to the size of `console` and the tile size of `atlas`.

    If `target` is NULL when the current render target is used instead, the
    drawn area will not be scaled to fit the render target.

    If SDL2 ever provides a `SDL_RENDER_TARGETS_RESET` event then the console
    at `*cache` must be deleted and set to NULL, or else the next render will
    only partially update the texture at `*target`.

    Returns a negative value on an error, check `TCOD_get_error`.

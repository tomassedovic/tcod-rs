  replaced with TCOD_sys_check_for_event and TCOD_sys_wait_for_event
- source width and height can be 0 in TCODConsole::blit to blit the whole console
- Some of the parser-related functions now can be chained.
- The RNG API now has less functions that choose the distribution based on the set flags.
- The noise API now has less functions that choose the noise type based on the set flags.
- Console default and cell foreground and background colour getters and setters renamed to more intuitive names:
  * `TCOD_console_set_background_color` => `TCOD_console_set_default_background`
  * `TCOD_console_set_foreground_color` => `TCOD_console_set_default_foreground`
  * `TCOD_console_get_background_color` => `TCOD_console_get_default_background`

- added `TCOD_BKGND_DEFAULT` as default value in rect / putChar / hline / vline / setBack
  the default background flag for a console is BKGND_NONE
    Warning ! That mean the rect/putChar/... functions now default to BKGND_NONE
    instead of BKGND_SET, except if you call setBackgroundFlag before using them.
- `TCODConsole::getHeight[Left/Right/Center]Rect` replaced by
  `TCODConsole::getHeightRect(int x, int y, int w, int h, const char *fmt, ...);`
  (the 3 functions were useless, the height does not depend on the alignement... X( )
- `TCODConsole::initRoot` has an additional renderer parameter:
  `static void TCODConsole::initRoot(int w, int h, const char * title, bool fullscreen = false, TCOD_renderer_t renderer=TCOD_RENDERER_SDL);`
  Possible values:
  - TCOD_RENDERER_GLSL
  - TCOD_RENDERER_OPENGL
  - TCOD_RENDERER_SDL
- `TCODMap::clear` now sets walkable and transparent status of all cells:
  `void TCODMap::clear` (bool transparent = false, bool walkable = false)
  `void TCOD_map_clear` (TCOD_map_t map, bool transparent, bool walkable)
  map_clear (map, transparent, walkable)
- cmake compilation works on FreeBSD thanks to namor_
- Restrictive FOV algo updated to MRPAS v1.1 (faster, better-looking, improved symmetry)
- Gaussian distribution in `TCODRandom` now uses a more precise Box-Muller transform algorithm
- More default values for `printFrame`:

  - fonts/consolas_unicode_12x12.png
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_16x16.png
  - fonts/consolas_unicode_8x8.png

### Changed
- the random number generator module now support two algorithms (Mingos)
  Mersenne twister, used in previous versions of libtcod
  Complementary Multiply With Carry, 2 to 3 times faster and has a much better
  period. This is the default algo.
  You can choose the algorithm in the constructor:
  ```c
  typedef enum {
    TCOD_RNG_MT,
    TCOD_RNG_CMWC
  } TCOD_random_algo_t;
  ```
  - TCODRandom() => CMWC, default seed
  - TCODRandom(uint32 seed) => CMWC, custom seed
  - TCODRandom(TCOD_random_algo_t algo) => default seed, custom algo
  - TCODRandom(uint32 seed, TCOD_random_algo_t aldo) => custom algo and seed
- TCODConsole::printFrame now takes an extra argument: TCOD_bkgnd_flag_t

  available algorithms :
  - FOV_BASIC: classic libtcod fov
  - FOV_DIAMOND: http://www.geocities.com/temerra/los_rays.html
  - FOV_SHADOW: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=FOV_using_recursive_shadowcasting
  - FOV_PERMISSIVE: http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Precise_Permissive_Field_of_View
  - light_walls: if false, wall cells are not put in the fov
- `setCustomFont` changed:
  defines the font number of characters instead of character size.
  if not specified, it is deduced from the layout flag
  (16x16 for ascii, 32x8 for tcod)
  `setCustomFont(const char *fontFile, int flags=TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INCOL,int nbCharHoriz=0, int nbCharVertic=0)`
  The flag values have changed too:
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INCOL=1
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INROW=2
   - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GREYSCALE=4
   - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GRAYSCALE=4
   - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_TCOD=8
- pathfinding: you don't need to provide coordinates in x,y parameters of
  `Path::walk`
- improved double/simple walls special characters in tcod layout fonts

### Fixed
- fixed SDL dependent features not being available before initRoot is called.
  If you want to draw on an offscreen console without calling initRoot, you

## [1.4.0] - 2008-10-16
### Added
- added pathfinding module
- added BSP module
- added heightmap module + heightmap tool
- added compression toolkit
- added possibility to pre-allocate TCODList's memory
- added support for PNG images + antialiased fonts from PNG with alpha channel or greyscale
- added ASCII mapping functions to map an ascii code to any character in your font:
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapAsciiCodeToFont(int asciiCode, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapAsciiCodesToFont(int firstAsciiCode, int nbCodes, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
  - `static void TCODConsole::mapStringToFont(const char *s, int fontCharX, int fontCharY);`
- parser : now strings can contain octal/hexadecimal ascii values
  - myStringProperty1 = "embedded hex value : \x80"
  - myStringProperty2 = "embedded octal value : \200"
- parser : now can handle list properties.
  ```c
  myStruct {
    myProperty = [1, 2, 3]
  }
  ```
  to declare: `struct.addListProperty("myProperty",TCOD_TYPE_INT,true);`
  to read (default parser): `TCODList<int> prop(parser.getListProperty("myStruct.myProperty", TCOD_TYPE_INT));`
- added color map generator. Interpolate colors from an array of key colors :
   `TCODColor::genMap(TCODColor *map, int nbKey, TCODColor const *keyColor, int const *keyIndex)`
- added random generator backup function. You can save the state of a generator
  with `TCODRandom *TCODRandom::save()` and restore it with
  `void TCODRandom::restore(const TCODRandom *backup)`
- added simplex noise, similar to perlin but faster,
  especially in 4 dimensions and has better contrast:
  - `TCODNoise::getSimplex`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbmSimplex`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulenceSimplex`
  Simplex should be preferred over Perlin for most usages.
- added wavelet noise, similar to perlin, much slower but doesn't blur at high scales. Doesn't work in 4D :
  - `TCODNoise::getWavelet`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbmWavelet`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulenceWavelet`
  Noise functions relative times:

  |       |2D|3D|4D|
  |:------|-:|-:|-:|
  |simplex| 1| 1| 1|
  |perlin | 4| 5|17|
  |wavelet|32|14| X|
- you can capture a console to an existing image without creating a new image
  with `TCODImage::refreshConsole`
- non rectangular offscreen consoles:
  you can define a key color on offscreen consoles.
  Cells for which background color = key color are not blitted
- added libtcod credits function. You can either call:
  `TCODConsole::credits()` to print the credits page at the start of your game
  (just after `initRoot`) or
  `bool TCODConsole::renderCredits(int x, int y, bool alpha)` to print the
  credits on top of one of your existing page (your game menu for example).
  Call it until it returns true.

### Changed
- Noise functions renamed:
  - `TCODNoise::getNoise` -> `TCODNoise::getPerlin`
  - `TCODNoise::getFbm` -> `TCODNoise::getFbmPerlin`
  - `TCODNoise::getTurbulence` -> `TCODNoise::getTurbulencePerlin`
- Some special char constants `TCOD_CHAR_x` added/removed

  flags:
  - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_ASCII_INROW=1
  - TCOD_FONT_TYPE_GREYSCALE=2
  - TCOD_FONT_LAYOUT_TCOD=4
- improved `TCODConsole::flush` performances:
   frames per second for sample "True colors" (terminal.png font) on my
   reference computer (windowed mode):
   - libtcod 1.3.2:  130
   - libtcod 1.4.0:  300
- `TCODNoise::getTurbulence` is twice faster
- improved mouse click detection. Even with a low framerate, mouse clicks will
  always be detected and reported in the `Xbutton_pressed` fields of
  `TCOD_mouse_t`
- you don't need anymore to provide values in `TCODLine::step` parameters

### Fixed

  - `rbutton_pressed`: right button pressed event
  - `mbutton_pressed`: middle button pressed event

  and to get the mouse movement in cell coordinates (instead of pixels)
- added functions to retrieve data from TCODMap

### Changed
- now TCODConsole::putChar/setChar can use ascii code > 255 (ok, it's no more an ascii code, then)
  this allows you to use fonts with more than 255 characters.

### Fixed
- fixed const correctness in `TCODConsole::print*Rect` functions
- fixed a bug in fov toolkit if TCODMap width < height
- fixed `TCOD_struct_get_type` returning `TCOD_TYPE_NONE` instead of
  `TCOD_TYPE_BOOL` for flags.

- added the file parser module
- added TCODColor::setHSV(float h, float s, float v) and TCODColor::getHSV(float *h, float *s, float *v)

  - 1.2.2 : `TCODColor mycol={r,g,b};`
  - 1.3   : `TCODColor mycol(r,g,b);`
- TCOD_console_check_for_keypress now has a parameter that indicates which events are tracked
  - 1.2.2 : `key = TCOD_console_check_for_keypress();`
  - 1.3   : `key = TCOD_console_check_for_keypress(TCOD_KEY_PRESSED);`
- now `TCODFov::computeFov` takes a maxRadius parameter.
  Use 0 for unlimited range (default)
- the mouse cursor is now automatically hidden when using fullscreen
- fixed closing the window resulting in a fake 'Q' keyboard event
- fixed `TCODConsole::print*` and `TCODConsole::rect` functions crashing when
  printing out of the console

  using a rectangle height of 0 means unlimited height
- fixed a color bug when drawing text using the black color (0,0,0)

- fixed console print*Rect functions unnecessarily splitting the string in some cases
- on Linux, you don't need to link with SDL anymore when using libtcod/libtcod++
- fixed linker issues with Visual Studio

## [1.2] - 2008-02-26
### Added
- new 'image' toolkit replacing some of the features previously in the 'system' toolkit.
- now windowed mode works even on 16bits desktops
- improved custom font support.
  You can now use fonts with characters ordered in rows or columns and with a custom transparent color.
  This allows you to use most existing character sets with the doryen library.
  Font characters with grayscale are still not supported.
- new time functions:
  - `uint32 TCODSystem::getElapsedMilli()`
  - `float TCODSystem::getElapsedSeconds()`
- new background blending modes (see the line sample for a demo) :
  - TCOD_BKGND_LIGHTEN : newbk = MAX(oldbk,curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_DARKEN  : newbk = MIN(oldbk,curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_SCREEN  : newbk = white - (white - oldbk) * (white - curbk) // inverse of multiply : (1-newbk) = (1-oldbk)*(1-curbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_COLOR_DODGE : newbk = curbk / (white - oldbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_COLOR_BURN : newbk = white - (white - oldbk) / curbk
  - TCOD_BKGND_ADD : newbk = oldbk + curbk
  - TCOD_BKGND_ADDALPHA(alpha) : newbk = oldbk + alpha * curbk, 0.0<=alpha<=1.0
  - TCOD_BKGND_BURN : newbk = oldbk + curbk - white
  - TCOD_BKGND_OVERLAY : newbk = curbk <= 0.5 ? 2*curbk*oldbk : white - 2*(white-curbk)*(white-oldbk)
  - TCOD_BKGND_ALPHA(alpha) : newbk = (1.0f-alpha)*oldbk + alpha*(curbk-oldbk), 0.0<=alpha<=1.0
- The samples can now use custom bitmap fonts / screen resolution. Use following syntax :
  sample_c[pp] [options]
  options :
  * -fullscreen : start directly in fullscreen mode
  * -font <font_filename> (default "terminal.bmp")
  * -font-char-size <char_width> <char_height> (default 8 8)
  * -font-layout <nb_char_horiz> <nb_char_vertic> (default 16 16)
  * -font-in-row : characters in the bitmap are ordered in rows (default : columns)
  * -font-key-color <r> <g> <b> : transparent color, r,g,b between 0 and 255. (default 0 0 0)
  * -fullscreen-resolution <width> <height> (default 640 400)

### Changed
- headers renamed from `tcodlib.h*` to `libtcod.h*`
- on Linux, the library is split into `libtcod.so` and `libtcod++.so`
  allowing C developers to use it without installing g++
- the font name is no more a parameter of `TCODConsole::initRoot`
- `TCODConsole::setBitmapFontSize` renamed to `TCODConsole::setCustomFont`
- `TCODConsole::printFrame` is now a variadic function, like the other text output functions
- some background blending flags have been renamed:
  - `TCOD_BKGND_NOBK` replaced by `TCOD_BKGND_NONE`
  - `TCOD_BKGND_BK` replaced by `TCOD_BKGND_SET`
- the fov toolkit now uses two properties per cell : `transparent`/`walkable`.
  This is necessary to fix a fov issue with window cells (transparent, but not walkable).
  `void TCODFov::setTransparent(int x,int y, bool isTransparent)` has been replaced by :
  `void TCODFov::setProperties(int x,int y, bool isTransparent, bool isWalkable)`
- improved const correctness, added some default parameter values in the C++ API.

### Fixed
- fixed the window size when using a custom font size
- fixed `TCODK_PRINTSCREEN` key event not detected
- fixed crash in printing functions if the string length was > 255.
  Now they can handle strings of any size.

## [1.1] - 2008-01-27
### Added
- added the noise toolkit
- added the field of view toolkit
- added customizable bitmap font size

## [1.0.1] - 2008-01-19
### Added
- added C/C++ samples

### Changed
- `TCODConsole::waitForKeyPress` now has a bool parameter indicating if we
  flush the keyboard buffer before waiting.

### Fixed
- fixed a color bug when drawing text using the grey color (196,196,196)
- fixed wrong key codes returned by wait/checkForKeyPress on some keyboard layouts

## [1.0] - 2008-01-05
- Initial release
